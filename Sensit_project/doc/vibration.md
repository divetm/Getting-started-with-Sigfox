# Vibration firmware

This sample code is a reproduction of the Sens'it Discovery's Vibration mode.

## What it does

With the Vibration firmware, your Sens'it will send a Sigfox message using the Sens'it Discovery payload format every time a movement is detected.  
You can also force a message sending with a double press on the button.

This firmware is compatible with the [sensit.io](https://www.sensit.io) application.

## How to Build

To build this firmware, use the `make vibration` command.

If you want to change the motion detection sensitivity, you can edit the `VIBRATION_THRESHOLD` and `VIBRATION_COUNT` defines.
